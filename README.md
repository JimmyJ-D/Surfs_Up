## Overview and Parameters
Using Python and imported tools, we analyze the temperatures on the island of Oahu to determine if a Ice Cream Surf shop is sustainable year round. Specifically, we will compare the mean, minimal, and maximum temperatures for the months of June and December.


### June and December Temperatures
Using SQlite and SQlAlchemy we extracted the statistical temperatures for June and December.

![June Summary](https://github.com/JimmyJ-D/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resource/June%20Summary%20Statistics.png)

1. The mean difference between temperatures in June and December is only ~ 3 degrees
2. The maximum temperature difference from June to December is 2 degrees
3. The greatest temperature difference between June and December is the minimal temperature. December minimal temperature is 8 degrees cooler than June minimal temperature

### Summary
The initial data shows very promising results for a constance mild temperature with only 3.74 standard deviation in degrees. The mild and constant temperature can attract similar clients year round to the Surf shop. While there is only 4 degrees average temperature deviation for the year, we should also compare and plot precipitation and wind. Adding these two parameters to the deliverable can provide a more in depth forecasting for surfing and consuming ice cream outdoors on the island of Ohau.
