# Surfs Up Module 9 Challenge
Using Python, SQlite, SQlAlchemy

## Overview and Parameters
Using Python and imported tools, we analyze the temperatures on the island of Oahn to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. Specifically, we will compare the mean, minimal, and maximum temperatures for the months of June and December.


### June and December Temperatures
Using SQlite and SQlAlchemy we extracted the statistical temperatures for June and December.

![June Summary](githubaddress)

1. The mean difference between temperatures in June and December is only ~ 3 degrees
2. The maximum temperature difference from June to December is 2 degrees
3. The greatest temperature between June and December is the minimal temperature. December is minimal temper is 8 degrees cooler than the minimal temperature in June.

### Summary
The initial data shows very promising results for a constance mild temperature with only 3.74 standard deviation in degrees. The mild and constance temperature can attract similar clients year round. While the temperature only shows mild deviation for the year, we should also compare and plot precipitation and wind. Adding these two parameters to the deliverable can provide more in depth forecast for surfing and consuming ice cream.
